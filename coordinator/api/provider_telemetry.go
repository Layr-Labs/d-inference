// maxPlausibleDecodeTPS is the sanity ceiling applied to the telemetry-only
// ActualDecodeTPS before it is persisted. Real decode throughput on the fleet's
// Apple-silicon hardware is in the tens-to-low-hundreds of tokens/sec; this
// ceiling is far above any genuine value and exists solely to stop a dishonest
// or buggy provider's unbounded CompletionTokens from writing an absurd TPS that
// could skew routing calibration. The value is advisory, never a security gate.
