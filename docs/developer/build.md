# Build The Provider, Retained Console And Landing

> Last updated: 2026-10-13

Build the provider, its source-matched native resources, and the independent
landing site from this repository. The existing console snapshot and its build,
lint, test and hosting configuration remain here; new console development belongs
to the platform. Backend, sidecar and admin builds belong to that sibling repository.

## Prerequisites

Use sibling `Darkbloom/d-inference` and `Darkbloom/darkbloom-platform` checkouts.
Verify your remote and branch first; do not upload backend code here.
Install the versions in `mise.toml` and initialize recursive submodules:

```bash
mise install
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Native provider builds require Apple Silicon and the Xcode/Metal toolchain
selected by `scripts/prepare-provider-release-toolchain.sh`. Do not substitute
an arbitrary prebuilt metallib or infer GPU qualification from compilation.
Keep separate worktrees/output directories for independent native builds;
never share an active Swift scratch path or another suite's GPU reservation.

## Build

```bash
make provider-build
make ui-install ui-build
make landing-install landing-build
```

`make provider-build` builds Swift products and stages the metallib through
`scripts/fetch-metallib.sh`. The kernel source is nested under
`libs/mlx-swift/Source/Cmlx/mlx`, matching the Cmlx target. Top-level `libs/mlx`
is a separate dependency pin. Native resources must match the compiled host
library; a warm cache cannot waive that requirement.

The SDK has independent test products under `libs/mlx-swift-lm`; rebuild and
stage their resources as well as the provider test product when validating a
native runtime change. The SDK's `MiMoOpenRouter` media fixtures are test-only
resources, not provider product resources. MiMo provider fixture preparation
uses bounded synthetic weights; the genuine audio codec is a separately
hash-verified input. See [provider and SDK tests](test.md#provider-and-sdk).

Native checkpoint and live-attention precision changes require the matching
provider and SDK pins. Build both test products before the
[checkpoint-storage gates](test.md#native-inference-checkpoint-storage-qualification);
a new CLI alone does not update an old test binary or qualify a checkpoint format.

`landing/` has its own npm lockfile, configuration and API routes. It needs a
Next.js server runtime, not static file hosting. Follow its [README](../../landing/README.md)
for local development; keep production credentials out of builds and tests.

## SDK 27 Release Builds And Caches

Release compilation and SDK qualification use separate
`blacksmith-12vcpu-macos-27` runners. Signed validation's older-OS smoke uses
`blacksmith-12vcpu-macos-26`. The macOS 27 image is a public beta;
`scripts/prepare-provider-release-toolchain.sh` resolves its selected Xcode
after checkout and requires SDK 27.0 and Apple Swift 6.4. Its
`scripts/provider-release-swift.sh` wrapper keeps native SwiftPM compilation
and linking on that SDK. Ordinary development retains the package's Swift 6.3
minimum; release evidence must use the selected release toolchain.

Pinned Python 3.12.10 and checksum-verified CMake 3.31.12 provide missing build
tools. `scripts/prepare-metal-toolchain.py` requires a working compiler probe,
not merely a completed component download. It clears stale discovery state,
waits boundedly for registration, and uses Apple's component export/import
fallback. The specific transient asset-catalog download error gets at most
three attempts within the setup deadline; other failures remain fatal. It
never silently switches to an older Xcode.

Both release lanes call `.github/actions/provider-release-build/action.yml`.
Only optimized compilation transfers an unsigned app, its inventory, SwiftPM
resource bundles and matching metallib to signing. Qualification runs the
provider tests and isolated native gates; restoring a cache never skips them.
Signing verifies the source, version, SDK, inventory and entitlements before
importing its certificate. See [release qualification](test.md#sdk-27-release-qualification).

## The `dev` branch

The `dev` branch is master plus one commit. On it, a plain `swift build` is a
DevNet build: `DARKBLOOM_RELEASE_ENVIRONMENT` defaults to `dev`, so the
provider talks to `https://api.dev.darkbloom.dev` and nothing else. On master
the default is `prod`. Set `DARKBLOOM_RELEASE_ENVIRONMENT=prod` to build a
production binary from the `dev` branch.

Use the `dev` branch to run a provider from source against the DevNet
coordinator. Published dev providers do not come from this branch: a master
push that changes the provider publishes one through `release-swift.yml`
(see `docs/operations/provider-release.md`).

Rules for the branch:

- Merge master into `dev` to update it. Never merge `dev` into master.
- Never tag a commit on `dev`. Tags publish production.
- Code changes go to master through a pull request, then reach `dev` by
  merging master. Only the default-environment commit lives on `dev` alone.

`scripts/provider-release-cache.py` separates optimized and qualification Swift
caches by compiler/SDK, architecture, absolute checkout/toolchain paths,
dependency pins and build recipe. `DARKBLOOM_RELEASE_ENVIRONMENT` also separates
dev and prod products. A source commit identifies an immutable generation;
compatible restore prefixes never cross these boundaries. The Metal cache
includes nested MLX source, compiler binary SHA and CMake recipe identity.

The cache's `snapshot-mtimes` and `restore-mtimes` commands restore timestamps
only for tracked files whose contents are unchanged. They do not restore source
contents or touch untracked files, links, Git metadata or paths outside the
checkout. Changed/new files rebuild. Runtime resources are restaged and verified
after restoration; archive caching is not permission to reuse stale resources.

`.github/workflows/provider-release-cache.yml` warms both lanes on relevant
`master` changes and release-plumbing PRs. PR caches do not seed `master`; tags
can restore default-branch caches but not another tag's cache. Successful
compilation can save objects even if later qualification fails, while publication
remains blocked. Runner quotas can serialize the two jobs; measure transfer,
build and whole-job time rather than promising a fixed release duration.

`scripts/stage-swiftpm-resource-bundles.sh` restores resource bundles alongside
the selected product without treating an old build-directory layout as a
resource authority. Keep its archive/path checks and source-matched staging;
see [resource and release tooling checks](test.md#focused-tooling-checks).

## App Attest Release Qualification

Build the local dispatch, worker and endpoint-resumption test targets through
`make provider-test`. Their loopback/software callback tests are not evidence
of Apple's service or a signed release. The
[native serving qualification](test.md#native-serving-qualification) entry is
compiled into the normal CLI but refuses without explicit opt-in and a verified
release app.

For physical diagnostics, use the separate
[local signed-app procedure](../../scripts/nativequalification/README.md#build-and-sign).
Freeze source and take exclusive ownership of its `.build` directory before
building. Do not replace the installed app or reuse a debug binary. The
default-off [worker selection](../reference/configuration.md#app-attest-worker-qualification)
also reaches background serving through the saved LaunchAgent plist;
diagnostic/fault flags are not forwarded. The staging helper neither publishes
nor notarizes, alters the installer/profile contract, or approves a build.

Use SDK 27 for Apple code-measurement extensions and set `SDKROOT` for both
compilation and linking. Verify the final executable's `LC_BUILD_VERSION` with
`xcrun vtool -show-build`, not merely the compiler's SDK argument. SDK 26 shadow
proofs do not establish replacement readiness. See the
[SDK and measurement contract](../reference/app-attest-shadow.md#macos-sdk-and-signed-code-measurements).
New source or diagnostic changes require new signed-artifact identity and
physical evidence; previous component, loaded-engine or Stage C passes do not
qualify a rebuilt binary, OS transition, reboot, update or fleet rollout.

After packaging the optimized provider with its resources, run:

```bash
DARKBLOOM_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1 DARKBLOOM_GEMMA4_PREFILL_CHUNK_EVAL=18 \
MLX_GEMMA4_FUSED_WEIGHTED_UNSORT=1 MLX_GATHER_QMM_EXPERT_SLICES=1 \
Darkbloom.app/Contents/MacOS/darkbloom runtime-smoke
```

Require the environment line
`build-environment-runtime-smoke: <prod|dev> coordinator=<url> cdn=<url>`
to match the release environment, plus all four markers:
`app-attest-callback-runtime-smoke: ok`,
`gemma-optimizations-runtime-smoke: ok`, `paged-kernel-runtime-smoke: ok`, and
`qwen4-metal-resources-runtime-smoke: ok`. The inherited MLX latches match
installer/updater launches. Callback completion and expiry use no Apple service
or Keychain item; this linked-binary smoke is not physical Apple qualification.

## Retained Console

`make ui-install` installs the console dependencies and `make ui-build` runs its
Next.js production build. For local preview, run `npm run dev` in `console-ui/`.
The existing `ui-lint`, `ui-test` and aggregate `ui` targets remain available,
along with the console CI lane and console-only pre-commit lint hook.

The console uses `console-ui/` as its hosting project root and requires a Next.js
server for same-origin `/api/*` routes, not static export. Existing
`console-ui/vercel.json` hosting configuration remains in place. Configure the
build-time public variables in the [configuration reference](../reference/configuration.md#console-ui)
and use a real Privy app for a hosted deployment; missing/placeholder Privy
configuration selects mock authentication. See [console architecture](../architecture/components/console-ui.md).
Retaining source or running a build does not authorize hosting or traffic changes.

## Verify

Follow [test](test.md) for provider, SDK and public fixture checks. Build success
does not prove runtime parity, real Apple attestation, model quality or a release.
Provider signing/publication follows [the release runbook](../operations/provider-release.md).
That pipeline registers exact official build identity automatically; runtime
Apple verification remains separate, and release execution still needs explicit
human authorization. It uses trusted-source checks, not GitHub environment gates.

Changelog checks use Python's standard library. Run `make changelog-check` and
`make changelog-preview`; neither edits `CHANGELOG.md`. Only authorized release
preparation renders selected fragments into history. See
[contribution guidance](../../CONTRIBUTING.md#changelog-entries-with-less-merge-contention).

The public provider must build without backend source or a private checkout.
Private cross-implementation qualification remains a platform-owned gate, not
a hidden prerequisite fetched by the public build. See [ownership](navigation.md)
and the [immutable platform build reference](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/darkbloom-platform/blob/48a198c71a2d30feec5597bacf1101120f7f955d/docs/developer/build.md).
That pinned reference is historical context, not current backend source authority.

## Troubleshooting

Use source-matched submodules, the documented Xcode SDK and fresh resources when
diagnosing native failures. Preserve cache identity checks; do not bypass them
to reuse incompatible artifacts. Run `make clean` only when its provider/console/landing
artifact removal is intended. Never erase live provider state as build cleanup.

Do not repair an old backend trigger by reintroducing backend build targets here.
Backend build and deployment configuration belongs in the platform repository.
