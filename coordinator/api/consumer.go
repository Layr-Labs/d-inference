// Consumer-facing API handlers for the Darkbloom coordinator.
//
// This file implements the OpenAI-compatible HTTP endpoints that consumers
// use to send inference requests. The coordinator acts as a trusted routing
// layer between consumers and providers.
//
// Trust model:
//   The coordinator runs in a Confidential VM, providing hardware-encrypted
//   memory. Consumers may additionally sender-seal requests to the
//   coordinator's X25519 key. The coordinator decrypts for routing purposes
//   but never logs prompt content, then re-encrypts each request to the
//   selected provider's X25519 public key before forwarding over the
//   WebSocket. Providers are attested via Secure Enclave challenge-response.
